 - title: The Digital Slide Archive and TCGA
   description-para-1: "The Cancer Digital Slide Archive is a website that hosts whole-slide images of pathologic specimens associated with the TCGA studies. At over 10,000 images and 20 Terabytes, the CDSA has enabled a number of the TCGA Analysis Working Group Studies [sources], as well as other investigator-driven studies that utilize the digital pathology images [sources]<br><br>
   The Digital Slide Archive project builds on the success of our experience with the Cancer Digital Slide Archive, creating a software platform that allows users to create their own digital pathology servers to support data management and hosting for their own investigations.  Comments about who else is using this."
